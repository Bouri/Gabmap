# Gabmap

*Doing dialect analysis on the web*

Gabmap is a web-based application for common tasks in
[dialectometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectometry).

The main website for Gabmap is [gabmap.nl](http://www.gabmap.nl/),
which allows anyone to create a user and use the application.

To run Gabmap on your own web server, you can download it from Github.
Some random notes can be found in INSTALL, and work to make it easier
to install is underway, but there is no proper installation guide at
the moment.

Gabmap is developed in [University of Groningen](http://www.rug.nl),
department of [Information Science](http://www.rug.nl/let/onderwijs/afdelingen/informatiekunde/index) 
(See CREDITS for a list of people contributed to Gabmap).
