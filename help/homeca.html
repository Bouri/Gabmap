  <title>Option: Cronbach's alpha</title>
</head>
<body>

Because the calculation of 
<a href="help?s=ca">Cronbach's alpha</a> is time-consuming for large
data sets, and because the value is usually near maximum for large
data sets, by default, we calculate Cronbach's alpha only for small and
medium sized data sets.
