<body>

The measure of <b>Importance</b> is a recent, minor variation of the
well known <a href="help?s=f1score" target="_blank">F1 score</a>.
<p>
Importance introduces a correction for expected outcome on F1's
      <em>Precision</em>, and calls it <b>Distinctiveness</b>. But
      F1's <em>Recall</em> is renamed to <b>Representativeness</b>
      without such correction for expected outcome. This turns a
      symmetric measure into an asymmetric measure. (A further variation
      is to use the arithmetic mean instead of the harmonic
      mean, because you can't use the latter with negative fractions.)
<p>
Unlike the F1 score, Importance depends on the amount of <em>false
	negatives</em> in the data retrieval. This makes it more error
	prone in a situation where various amounts of data are unavailable.
This is the reason why, in Gabmap, it can't be used in the
<a href="help?s=cludetfast" target="_blank">fast method</a>.
<p>
One author of Importance tells they wanted to introduce more
      weight to one part of the equation over the other part. Of course,
      the right way to do this is to use a known variant of the F1
      score, for example the F2 score or the F0.5 score.
<p>
No tests are available that show that the measure of Importance has any
      advantage over the F1 score (or over any other known measure used in
      information retrieval).
