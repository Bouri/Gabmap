The measure of Importance is described in:

<ul>
<li>WIELING, Martijn & John NERBONNE (to appear)<br>
  ‘Bipartite spectral
  graph partitioning for clustering dialect varieties and detecting their
  linguistic features’. <em>Computer Speech and Language</em>.
  doi:10.1016/j.csl.2010.05.004<br>
  Available online (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/">http://www.sciencedirect.com/</a>) since May 21, 2010.
</ul>

The use of Importance in Gabmap necessarily deviates from the use in the above cited
    paper. The paper applies Importance to data that consists of places
    and sound correspondences. In Gabmap our data consists of responses
    and variants, where each unique variant can represent one or more
    linguistic features.
<p>
The second author of the paper allows that variants can be used instead
    of sound correspondences, but insists that the formula for Importance can only be
    applied to data of places. (Personal communication. No such
    limitation is posed in the paper.)
<p>
So, instead of evaluating the raw data, we must reduce the data over places, into one
      group of places where a wanted variant occurs (for each place, this can be sometimes or
      always), and another group of places where no such variant occurs (whether
      or not we even have any data for those places).
<p>
This method does not work well. Useful information is lost.
Some uninteresting items get a high
      score, just because they have many different variants in single
      places. Some interesting items get a very low score, just because
      they have data for less places than other items.
