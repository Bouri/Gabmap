The measure of <u>Importance</u> is described in:

<ul>
<li>WIELING, Martijn & John NERBONNE (to appear)<br>
  ‘Bipartite spectral
  graph partitioning for clustering dialect varieties and detecting their
  linguistic features’. <em>Computer Speech and Language</em>.
  doi:10.1016/j.csl.2010.05.004<br>
  Available online (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/">http://www.sciencedirect.com/</a>) since May 21, 2010.
</ul>

The use of Importance in Gabmap necessarily deviates from the use in the above cited
    paper. The paper applies Importance to data that consists of places
    and sound correspondences. In Gabmap our data consists of responses
    and variants, where each unique variant can represent one or more
    linguistic features.
<p>
The second author of the paper allows that variants can be used instead
    of sound correspondences, but insists that the formula for Importance can only be
    applied to data of places. (Personal communication.)
<p>
So, instead of evaluating the raw data, we must reduce the data over places, into one
      group of places where a wanted variant occurs (for each place, this can be sometimes or
      always), and another group of places where no such variant occurs (whether
      or not we even have any data for those places).
<p>
This method does not work well. In fact, a better method is available in
      Gabmap. For who is interested, contact support@gabmap.nl


<h3>The problem</h3>

In Gabmap's <em>cluster determinants</em>, we select a linguistic item, we draw a set of word
    patterns from it, and score it for its match to a predefined geographic
    region. Then we take another linguistic item, draw a set of word
    patterns, and score it for its match with the same predefined geographic
    region.
<p>
We cannot compare these two scores, because they are of draws from
different data collections. Those data collections can at times be very
      different from each other in the way they cover the geographic
      region.

<h3>Some answers</h3>

There are two ways to deal with the problem.

<ol>

<li>Use a method for scoring that is
    reasonably robust in this situation, and just analyse the data as it
    is. In Gabmap we don't need an accurate score. We only need a score
    that is good enough to point us to linguistic items that merit
    further inspection.

<li>You can &quot;map&quot; the data onto the map, so instead of
      responses with some features, we have locations with
      some features. The locations are identical.
</ol>

Number 1 works quite effectively, as experiments in Gabmap have shown.
However, it is not the way it is currently done.

<p>
Number 2 is the way it is now done in Gabmap. But the method for
    mapping is very crude. As a result, the scores don't help us find
    interesting features as well as they should. 
<p>
What is needed is an accurate way to map data onto the map. First, we
      would have to use per location ratios of occurrences of desired
      patterns, instead of a binary 1 (it occurs once or more) or 0 (it
      does not occur). Second, we need to give a reasonable estimate for
      locations without data, by interpolating, based on geographic
      distribution, from locations that do have data. A best guess.
      Currently, this is
      not the way it is done in Gabmap.
