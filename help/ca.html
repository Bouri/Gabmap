  <title>Cronbach's alpha</title>
</head>
<body>

Summarised from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:
<blockquote>
Cronbach's α (alpha) is a coefficient of reliability. It is commonly
      used as a measure of the internal consistency or reliability of a
      psychometric test score for a sample of examinees. 
<p>
Cronbach's α can be defined as
<p>
<img src="../img/ca.png"  alt="\alpha = {K \bar c \over (\bar v + (K-1) \bar c)}">
<p>
where K is the number of components (<em>K-items</em> or
	<em>testlets</em>),
<img src="../img/barv.png"  alt="\bar v"> the
	average variance, and
<img src="../img/barc.png"  alt="\bar c"> the average of all covariances
	between the components across the current sample of persons.

</blockquote>

In Gabmap, we use Cronbach's alpha in a different way. Normally, it is a
    measurement over data. But because our data is often not numeric, we
    have to process the data, to calculate the differences between
    locations, and then we apply Cronbach's alpha on those differences. 
<p>
So, in Gabmap, Cronbach's alpha is not a coefficient of reliability of
      the data, but a coefficient of reliability of the difference
      measurements over that data. This depends both on the quality of
      the data itself, and on the quality of the method used for the measurement.
<p>
For consistency, we do this even when the input data <em>is</em>
      numeric, though this gives different results then if we would
      apply Cronbach's alpha to the data itself.
