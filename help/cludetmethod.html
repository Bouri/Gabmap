  <title>Cluster determinants: methods</title>

<p>
Currently, Gabmap implements two cluster determinant methods. Cluster
determinants try to find items that are characteristic of a given
cluster (set of sites).
<ul>
<li> The first (recommended) cluster determinant, labeled 
    "<i>Distance based</i>" implements the method described in

the method is based on finding items that are uniform within the
cluster of interest, while different from the rest of the sites. The
two components <i>within difference</i> and <i>between difference</i>
characterize the average difference within the sites in the cluster, and the
average difference between the sites in the cluster and the rest of
the sites in the data set with respect to given item. Items whose
within difference is low, and between difference is high are regarded
as characteristic items, "shibboleths". The aggregate score provided
is either difference (default) or ratio of these two quantities. To
make the difference meaningful across different data sets, by default
the difference scores are normalized.
<li> The second method labeled "<i>Categorical</i>" is loosely based on
