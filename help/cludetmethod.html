  <title>Cluster determinants: methods</title>

<p>
Currently, Gabmap implements two cluster determinant methods. Cluster
determinants try to find items that are characteristic of a given
cluster (set of sites).
<ul>
<li> The first (<b>recommended</b>) cluster determinant, labeled 
    "<i>Distance based</i>" implements the method described in

the method is based on finding items that are uniform within the
cluster of interest, while different from the rest of the sites. The
two components <i>within difference</i> and <i>between difference</i>
characterize the average difference within the sites in the cluster, and the
average difference between the sites in the cluster and the rest of
the sites in the data set with respect to given item. Items whose
within difference is low, and between difference is high are regarded
as characteristic items, <i>shibboleths</i>. Since the raw differences
values differ based on different data sets, they are normalized so
that the differences are comparable across different data sets. The
aggregate score primarily used for sorting the items is simply 
<i>between_score - within_score</i>. 
(In earlier versions of Gabmap, an aggregate score based on geometric
mean between these two quantities are used such that the score is the
geometric mean of these two quantities if <i>within difference</i> is
negative and <i>between difference</i> positive, `0' otherwise.)

<p><a name="MissingData"><b>Missing values</b></a><br>
Calculation of differences between individual pairs of sites may fail,
typically, due to missing values (e.g., a pronunciation that has not
been recorded in a particular site). This may affect the
scale and the reliability of the average distance calculations  used
for this method. The option "Missing values" allows you to specify how to
treat missing values. A number between 0 and 1 is interpreted as the
minimum ratio of missing data allowed. While a number greater
than one indicates the absolute number of missing values allowed. If
the ratio or number of missing values is greater than the specified
limit the score is will show 'NA'. Otherwise, the average distances
will be calculated ignoring the missing values.

<li> The second method labeled "<i>Categorical</i>" is loosely based on
