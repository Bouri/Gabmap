  <title>F1 Score in Cluster Determinants</title>
</head>
<body>
(This text needs clarification.)
<p>
The formula for F1 score is
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>):
<p>
<pre>
                    2 * true positive
F1 = ---------------------------------------------------
     2 * true positive + false negative + false positive
</pre>
<p>
In Cluster Determinants, we introduce a small bias for larger files, by
      increasing the counts used in the formula by 1:
<p>
<pre>
                       2 * (true positive + 1)
F1 = ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 * (true positive + 1) + (false negative + 1) + (false positive + 1)
</pre>
<p>
The effect is that items with very much data can have a maximum score
      close to 1, and a minimum close to 0, but that items with less
      data have a slightly lesser range.
<p>
The basis for the modification is based on the following. If we have two
      counts, A and B, then the proportion of A in the total is A/(A+B). But
      if A and B are based on small samples from a very large set, then the best
      prediction of the proportion of A in the larger set is
      (A+1)/(A+1+B+1), assuming a uniform distribution of chances for
      all possible proportions.
