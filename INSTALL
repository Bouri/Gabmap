These are some unorganized notes regarding the requirements and
installation of the Gabmap files to a new environment.

The web application consists of a set of CGI scripts written in
python. The python scripts are started from shell scripts after
loading settings from a configuration scrip "INIT.sh". 

Typically, you would run the application from a user's web home, which
by default is $HOME/public_html/. For the rest of the document we
assume that you unpacked the package under $HOME/public_html/gabmap/,
and filenames and path names are given relative to this directory.

The applications start from script bin/home, and the whole(?) gabmap
directory should be accessible through the web.

The web server should allow executing CGI script in bin/ directory.
This can either be allowed in web server configuration like (for
apache):
    <Directory _path_to_gabmap_/bin/>
        Options ExecCGI
        SetHandler cgi-script
    </Directory>
or if allowed by the web server, using a .htaccess file in the bin/
directory with the same content:
        Options ExecCGI
        SetHandler cgi-script

The main configuration file for the utility is INIT.sh, the package
comes with a template, INIT.sh.template. You should copy this file as
INIT.sh, and edit to reflect the local settings.

The application requires python pyproj library. This  is not packaged
for Debian unstable (as of 2011-12-12), so it needs to be installed
manually. If it is installed in a non-standard path, the installation
path of pyproj is required to be in PYTHON3PATH variable in INIT.sh.

The RuG/L04 package needs to be installed and in PATH.

DATADIR should include a directory named .queue with read/write
permission to the web-server.

You need to type 'make' in the directory `util'.

R iL04 package has to be installed, and the R_LIBS has to be set
to correct location before creation of any project.

Another (relatively) non-standard python package requirement:
colormath.

The data directory and a subdirectory `.queue' under it needs to be
created at the beginning.
